    The Attributes menu contains commands which modify the
    display. In addition, the Properties menu allows property
    strings and values to be associated with objects (not used
    by KIC presently), and the Debug menu has commands for
    displaying some internal parameters.  Some commands provide
    temporary submenus.

    Commands are executed by pointing at the menu, or by typing
    the command prefix shown in upper case (input is case
    insensitive).  Commands can be exited by selecting another
    command in most cases, or by hitting the ESCAPE key.  Some
    commands are switches which remain in effect until selected

Electrical Parameters
!!TEXT
    KIC provides the facility for generating a readout of elec-
    trical parameters while creating rectangles.  One must supply
    the appropriate information to the desired layers in the
    technology file.  There are three possibilities: resistance,
    capacitance, or microstripline parameters.  The microstripline
    parameters assume that propagation is along the longer
    dimension of the rectangle.  The resistance readout provides
    information for both orientations.  The microstripline model
    assumes that the underlying area contains ground plane, with a
    specified dielectric thickness, i.e., no account is taken of
    the "real" geometry.

!!TEXT
    This command creates a family of KIC symbol files from a CIF
    database file.  The user is prompted for the name of the CIF
    file.  Care should be taken to avoid overwriting existing
    files during conversion, as there is no checking. The user
    is reminded of this by a message.  The converter has built-in
    intelligence to determine the style of CIF to be converted,
    which is one of

    KIC:      symbol name follows a DS command as in 9 PadIn;
    IGS:      symbol name follows a DS command as in 9 PadIn;
    Stanford: symbol name follows a DS command as in (PadIn);
    NCA:      symbol name follows a DS command as in (PadIn);
    Icarus:   symbol name follows a DS command as in (9 PadIn);
    Sif:      symbol name follows a DS command as in (Name: PadIn);
    none:     No symbol names.

    If no symbol name can be found, symbol files are named
    "symbolN" where N is the number of the symbol as known to CIF.

    Layers which are integers are mapped into the current layer 
    table, if the table entry corresponding to the number has been
    defined.  Otherwise, the line is left as is, e.g., "L 64;"
    would appear as "L 64;" in the KIC files (which would have to
    be altered later).  Similarly, layer names which are not found
    in the layer table remain unchanged.

    Using this command, a GDSII (Stream) file can be expanded into
    KIC files.  The file and symbol names are altered to be
    compatible with DOS in DOS versions of KIC, and an alias file
    "dos__str.als" is created in the current directory if it
    doesn't exit, and is added to if it does.  This file
    provides the mapping between the original and new symbol names,
    and is only created if a name required alteration.  The user
    is prompted for the name of the Stream file.  The converter
    creates KIC files, one for each symbol found in the Stream
    file.  Care should be taken to avoid overwriting existing
    files during conversion, as there is no checking for name
    collisions.  The layer mapping is taken from the technology
    file.  If the datatype obtained from the dotkic file is -1, the
    datatype given in the input is not comparison tested.  In this
    case, only the layer number is significant. Otherwise, the
    datatype must match the specified datatype for the layer.
    The valid stream layer numbers and data types are 0-255.

hcopy
!!TEXT
    This command brings up a submenu for generation of hard
    copy plots.  At present, the HP Laserjet PCL format and
    PostScript are supported.  To improve visibility of the
    plots, the layer fill patterns are set separately and may
    differ from those normally displayed.  These alternate
    fill patterns, grid display, and layer visibility choices
    are in effect only when the hcopy command is active.  The
    fill command in the submenu works identically to the normal
    fill command, however the alternate fill patterns are used.
    The grid command allows modification of the grid style
    displayed in the plot.  Layers can be made invisible
    (or visible) only during plotting with the visib command.
    These choices can be saved (in the technology file) with
    the updat command in the attriubutes menu.  The prn command
    allows a choice of output device driver or file names.
    The resol command can provide different print resolutions.
    Higher resolution gives better print quality but requires
    more time to produce.  Also, higher resolution causes
    the fill patterns to become finer, which may make layer
    differentiation more difficult.  The hctype command is used
    to determine the plot format, currently 'h' for HP PCL or
    'p' for PostScript.  Ordinarily, the full cell is plotted,
    notwithstanding what is displayed on the screen.  The
    frame command allows a portion of the cell to be plotted.
    The plot is actually generated with the go command.
    Rotated/mirrored text is not supported in PCL.

    viewports, a coarse view and a fine view.  The fine view is
    a magnification of a portion of the coarse view.  The ^N
    command saves the view, and the Last command can be invoked
    inside of most commands, so that the view can be altered 
    during geometry creation.  This facilitates wiring large

!!TEXT
    The stretch command operates on polygons, wires, and
    rectangles.  It enables moving of polygon and wire vertices,
    and rectangle corners.  The movement is constrained by the
    current setting of the TBRL button.

    If no geometry has been selected, the user is asked to point
    to an object to stretch.  Once an object is selected, the
    user is then prompted to point at a vertex, and the closest
    one to where the user points is active.  The user then points
    to the new location, and the vertex is then moved.  This move
    is constrained by the TBRL setting.  If the setting is "TBRL",
    there is no constraint.  If the setting is "TB", then only the
    Y part of the translation is performed, and likewise if the
    setting is "RL" only the X translation occurs.

    If there are several objects selected, then the vertex closest
    to where the user points is taken as the reference vertex.
    This vertex is translated to the new location.  In each of the
    other objects, the same transformation is applied to the
    vertex closest to the reference vertex.  Thus, a group of
    wires, for example, can all be extended at once.

techfile
!!TITLE
Technology File
!!TEXT
    The technology file tells KIC all it knows about the layers
    and display attributes.  The name of the file is "kic_tech", 
    and an extension .xxx can be added to the name, so that if KIC
    is started with the -t xxx option, the technology file with
    the extension will be used.  For example, kic -t trw would try
    to read kic_tech.trw.
    
    If no technology file is found in the current directory, a
    system-wide directory is searched.  This location can be set
    with the KIC_LIB_DIR environment variable.  The default
    technology file has been provided by your system administrator.
    A personalized version can be generated with the updat
    command.

    The technology file consists of a path specification, followed
    by several layer specifications, followed by the display
    attribute specifiers.

    The path consists of the characters "Path?" followed by space,
    followed by a space separated list of directories (format
    appropriate for the operating system) enclosed in parens.

    Aside from the path, the file is read without case
    sensitivity.

    The layer specification consists of a list of keywords in the
    order and format illustrated in the example below.  The layer
    name consists of four alphanumeric characters or fewer.  
    The color RGB is three numbers (RGB) each from 0-255.
    Following "Filled?" one can have "y" (solid fill), "n" (empty
    fill, thick outline), or eight bytes of hex code defining a
    fill pattern, followed by an optional "y" or "outline", which
    if present indicates that the pattern is outlined.  Examples:

      filled? y
      filled? cc aa cc aa cc aa cc aa outline

    The syntax is identical for "AltFilled", which sets the pattern
    for hardcopies.
    The number following "MinDimensions?" is the minimum feature
    size in microns.  A second number is the default wire width,
    which defaults to the minimum dimension.
    If the "Invisible" keyword is given, the layer is invisible by
    default.  Similarly, "AltInvisible" will hide the layer in
    hardcopies.
    If the "Symbolic?" keyword is followed by "y", the
    geometry is shown even when the cell is not expanded.  Normal
    layers should follow "Symbolic?" with "n".
    The two numbers following "StreamData" are the Stream layer
    number and data type used when converting to GDSII.
    The keywords "Tran", "Resis", and "Cap" signify electrial
    parameter specifications, only one of which can be used per
    layer.

    The display mode keywords are all optional.  GridSpacing is in 
    microns.  The following keywords indicate an attribute color:
      MenuPrompt, MenuText, MenuHighlighting, MenuSelect,
      MoreText, CoarseGrid, FineGrid, InstanceBox, InstanceName,
      InstanceSize.
    The last three set the colors used in unexpanded instances.
    Each is followed by either one or three integers.  If KIC is
    running on a system with less than 32 possible colors, the
    attribute colors and layer colors are merged, such that the
    attributes are mapped to specific layers for color reference.
    In this mode, KIC will generate a technology file with a single
    integer following the above parameters, which is the layer
    number for color reference.  Otherwise, three numbers are
    produced, which are the RGB values in the range 0-255.

    In addition, Highlighting and Background are followed by RGB
    values in either case.

    In merged mode, reading an RGB technology file will produce KIC
    internal layer references based on the best color match.  In
    non-merged mode, reading in a single integer technology file
    will load the independent color buffer with the corresponding
    layer's color.

    RoundFlashSides is followed by the number of segments used to
    approximate rounded geometries.  Highlighting and Background
    are followed by RGB values for the colors.  If ShowGrid is
    present the grid wil be shown, otherwise it is invisible by
    default.  If GridOnBottom is given, the grid will be below
    geometries, otherwise it is shown above.  If DisplayAllText
    is given, labels will be shown in the coarse viewport in
    split screen mode, otherwise labels are displayed only in 
    the fine viewport.  Similarly, if LabelAllInstances is
    present, instances will be labeled in the coarse viewport
    in split screen mode.  AltShowGrid controls grid display in
    hardcopies.  AltDevice gives the printer device name for hard
    copies, AltResolution gives the resolution, and AltFormat
    gives the format code for the plot data.

    The following is an example.  Text enclosed in square brackets
    is optional.  Other text is required.

    This function has two modes.  If there are wires selected,
    on the current layer with the layer button active, or any
    wires with the layer button inactive, KIC prompts for a
    new wire width for the selected wires.  If the layer button
    is active, only wires on the current layer have their
    widths changed, otherwise selected wires from all layers
    have their widths altered.  No checking is performed for
    minimum width violations in this mode.  The other mode sets
    the default wire width for the current layer, and this is
    constrained to be greater or equal to the minimum width.
    This mode is entered if there are no applicable wires
    selected when the width button is chosen.  Wires
    subsequently created on the present layer will have the new
    width.

    This mode facilitates inverting the polarity of layers.  The
    operation is similar to the boxes command, however all prev-
    iously existing boxes on the same layer which overlap the
    created box become holes in the new box.  Structures other
    than boxes are covered.  No checking is done for minimum
    feature size of the newly created geometry.
